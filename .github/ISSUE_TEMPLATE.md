>  If you get a runtime or TypeScript error, copy the text of the error message, from the JavaScript console, for example. Do not include a screenshot of the error message.

>  If the issue is with rendering of the math, please include the LaTeX code that is causing the issue as text. Do not include a screenshot of LaTeX code.

>  Do not include screenshots of code, error messages or LaTeX.


>  If you use React, Vue or some other framework, try to provide some code that replicates the issue using only plain JavaScript. If you can't, then include a link to a minimal project demonstrating the issue. This will make it **much** easier to reproduce the issue and fix it.
